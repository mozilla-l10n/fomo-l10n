msgid "Our <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> buyer’s guide comes with <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> warning labels on products we think consumers should think twice about before buying. It’s no small thing to assign such a label to a product, so we set ourselves some <a href=\"%(url)s\">strict standards</a>. If we can’t confirm a product meets our Minimum Security Standards, it automatically earned the <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> label, as we feel those standards are the minimum a product should meet to be on the market. We also look at how a company uses the data the product collects on you, how you can control the data the company collects, and what the company’s known track record is over the past two years for protecting their users’ data. How a company performs on these criteria determines if we assign them the warning label. You will see little <span class='mini-warning-ding-icon'>mini-warnings</span> in our review section of the guide to help you understand what our concerns are."

If a company does not provide a product-specific privacy notice, we rely on their general privacy policy for this information. This often means we cannot verify which information mentioned in a company’s privacy documentation may or may not be true about a specific product. In our requests for information from companies before publication, we ask for product-specific privacy policies and if a company shares it, we analyze the product-specific policy. We believe consumers should be able to access privacy policies and documentation before they purchase a product. Learning what data a company collects and how it uses that data is important to know before downloading an app or buying a product."

Then share it with your friends and family to help them shop safe too. We as consumers need to demand that privacy and security as a value from the people who build our products. It’s how we’ll start to make the internet, and our lives, a bit safer in this digital world. That is our goal every day here at Mozilla."
