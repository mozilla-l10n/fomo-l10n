msgid "<h2 class=\"tw-text-4xl medium:tw-text-[3.25rem] tw-leading-none\">People take a trial-and-error approach to controlling their recommendations.</h2> <p>In the qualitative portion of our study, we learned that people do not feel in control of their experience on YouTube, nor do they have clear information about how to curate their recommendations. Many people take a trial-and-error approach to controlling their recommendations using YouTube’s hodgepodge of options, like “Dislike,” “Not Interested,” and other buttons. It rarely works. Said one user:</p> <blockquote class=\"tw-text-white tw-font-zilla tw-text-[1.625rem] medium:tw-text-[1.75rem] tw-leading-8 tw-font-normal\">“Nothing changed. Sometimes I would report things as misleading and spam and the next day it was back in. It almost feels like the more negative feedback I provide to their suggestions the higher bulls**t mountain gets. <span class=\"tw-text-youtube-regrets-red\">Even when you block certain sources they eventually return.</span>” </blockquote> <p class=\"tw-text-xl tw-font-bold tw-font-changa\">When YouTube’s own controls fail, people take matters into their own hands, using tactics including VPNs, new devices, and altered behavior like not clicking on or hovering over videos.</p>"
