"        <p>While our research considers the broad spectrum of YouTube Regrets, it is important to note that some videos are worse than others. YouTube has Community Guidelines that set the rules for what is allowed on YouTube and what isn’t. Together with a team of research assistants from the University of Exeter, we evaluated the videos reported to us against these Community Guidelines and determined which ones should either not be on YouTube or not be recommended by YouTube. Of those videos, the most common category applicable was misinformation (especially COVID-19 related). The other largest categories were violent or graphic content, hate speech, and spam/scams. Other notable categories include child safety, harassment & cyberbullying, and animal abuse.</p>\n"

"                    <p>The concept of a “YouTube Regret” was born out of a <a href=\"#\">crowdsourced campaign</a> that Mozilla developed in 2019 to collect stories about YouTube’s recommendation algorithm leading people down bizarre and sometimes dangerous pathways. We have intentionally steered away from strictly defining what “counts” as a YouTube Regret to allow people to define the full spectrum of regrettable experiences that they have on YouTube.</p>\n"
"                    <p>What a YouTube Regret looks like for one person may not be the same for another, and sometimes YouTube Regrets only emerge after months or weeks of being recommended videos—an experience which is better conveyed through <a href=\"#\">stories</a> than video datasets.</p>\n"
"                    <p>This approach intentionally centers the lived experiences of people to add to what is often a highly legalistic and theoretical discussion. It does not yield clear distinctions about what type of videos should or should not be on YouTube or algorithmically promoted by YouTube. </p>\n"
