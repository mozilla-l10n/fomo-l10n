msgid "Our <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> buyer’s guide now comes with <em>*Privacy Not Included</em> warning labels on products we think consumers should think twice about before buying. It’s no small thing to assign such a label to a product, so we set ourselves some strict standards. If we can’t confirm a product meets our Minimum Security Standards, it automatically earned the <em>*Privacy Not Included label</em>, as we feel those standards are the minimum a product should meet to be on the market. We also look at how a company uses the data the product collects on you, how you can control the data the company collects, and what the company’s known track record is over the past two years for protecting their users’ data. How a company performed on these criteria determined if we assigned them the warning label. You will see little mini-warnings in our review section of the guide to help you understand what our concerns are."
